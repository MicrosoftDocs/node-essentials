# Node essentials

> This repository contains the source code for tutorials proposed in the [Node.js LEARN path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-github-cxa) and the [Beginner's video Series to Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-NodeJS?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-github-cxa).

## Overview

Learning any new technology is a time-consuming process where it's easy to get lost. This is why we created this series of practical, and focused modules about Node.js for beginners so you can get up to speed.

You'll find all the source code used in the [Learn modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-github-cxa) and [videos](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-NodeJS?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-github-cxa) to help you during your learning journey.

The full banking API source code shown in the Express videos can be found here: [WebDev for Beginners - Bank project](https://github.com/WebDev-Beginners/bank-project/tree/main/api)

And if you need to learn or improve your JavaScript skills, take a look at the [Beginner's video Series to JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-github-cxa).

## Next steps

Because learning is a never-ending journey, we want to help you as much as we can to get you ready for what's coming next. You'll find here a great collection of resources you can use to build your knowledge.
